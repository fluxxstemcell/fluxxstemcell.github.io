                <p>We are so pleased you have decided to incorporate the Fluxx Stem Cell Card Game into your curriculum. As part of this free online resource, we would like to provide you some guidelines and suggestions in order to help you incorporate our product seamlessly into your classroom!
                </p>
                <h4 style="color:#FF4242;">Where to find our product</h4>
                <p>You may already have found our website, where all of our materials are free and public. Our materials are available in a print-friendly format. In printing the cards, we recommend the use of cardstock or other thicker paper to ensure reusability. Cards can be printed double-sided or single-sided and adhered together.</p>
                <h4 style="color:#FFBB33;">Who this product is geared toward
</h4>
                <p>In creating this product, we have targeted children in middle school, specifically 6th and 7th grade students. At this age, they have a basic understanding of cellular biology and are at a critical age in considering which subjects they like and want to continue in the future. We have geared this game to help them become familiar with the concept of stem cells. We hope our game provides them a fun way to satisfy their curiosity without overloading them with information.</p>
                <h4 style="color:#99CC00;">How to use this in your classroom

</h4>
                <p>Since this is an add-on to the normal science curriculum, we recommend you utilize it before a scheduled break or at the end of a busy week. It is a great way to give students a break from normal material while preparing them for a possible future in stem cell research and applications.</p>
                <p>We recommend you use 1-2 class periods, depending on length of class to go through our material in sequential order:

                <div class="span5">
                    <h4 style="color:#34B6E5;">Class 1:</h4>
                    <p>>>>Navigating the website as a class, either using projector or going to a computer lab to allow all students to follow along.</p>
                    <p>>>>Reading through the informational powerpoint as a class and answering any initial question. After watching the video, a teacher could also pose a question regarding the content and have students navigate the website to find the answer.</p>
                    <p>>>>Explaining rules and gameplay. Using the website and re-reading the rules of the card game could be a possible homework assignment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="span5">
                    <h4 style="color:#34B6E5;">Class 2:</h4>
                    <p>>>>Play the card game, by breaking the class up into groups of 3-4 people, moving desks to make a gameplay surface, and reviewing the rules as a group. Games take between 15-25 minutes, so depending on length of class, one or two games can be played.</p>
                    <p>>>>The same groups can work together to complete the wordsearch puzzle, using the cards as guides. Using the description of a new term or item relating to stem cells, groups must figure out the word and find it among the letters. This could be a possible homework assignment.</p>
                    <p>>>>Discussion questions can then be posed to help students think through the material they have been exposed to. This could be a class discussion and/or a possible homework assignment.</p>
