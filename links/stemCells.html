    <h1>Adult vs IPS</h1>
  <p>Right now, there is a ton of cool research happening with special cells that come from the human body, called stem cells. As you may know, cells are small structural units that make up all the living things on earth. All cells have their own job, like some make up muscle tissue, some make up bones, and each have different instructions on what they should do. </p>
<p>All types of cells have different function and structure, but they all start as one less specific type of cell. These cells are called stem cells, and they have the ability to become any cell in the body. These cells each have a goal to become a type of cell in the body with a special job and structure. This special talent is called plasticity. Stem cells are plastic, meaning they turn into more specific types of cells with a special job. </p>
<p>The process of a stem cell specializing, being assigned a job, and changing structure is called differentiation. One can say that stem cells are undifferentiated, and a specific cell like a heart cell is terminally differentiated. This differentiation is controlled by the environment the cell is in, and what it is exposed to. However scientists have found out that differentiated cells can be reversed. Cells found in the body that already have a structure and job can be coached into being less and less specific, turning them back into a stem cell! After this they can differentiate again into many different types of cells. 
Many diseases that people suffer from can be cured or treated using stem cells! That’s why so many scientists are conducting research to fully understand them and find ways to make them. They are finding efficient ways to harvest stem cells from the body or alter cells to make them into stem cells.</p>
<p>Now that you know all about the basics of stem cells we can dive into two super interesting types of stem cells. </p>
<p>The first kind are called adult stem cells. These cells are stem cells that have found a home somewhere specific in the body called a niche. Adult stem cells have specific jobs (just like your parents!). Each job is related to where the stem cell lives. An adult stem cell that lives near muscle will help you to repair muscle to make you stronger. An adult stem cell that lives in with your bone will make blood cells and cells for your immune system to help fight disease. If a specific job needs to get done an adult stem cell will step to the plate and make a specific cell that can complete the job. The adult stem cell will duplicate itself into two, new, identical cells. One of these cells will change to specifically fit the job that needs completion and the other will remain an adult stem cell so it can keep duplicating itself to make more cells that will complete other jobs. Adult stem cells are cool because we can use your own adult stem cells to make lots of useful cells that will be specific to you. Your own, natural, cells are much more likely to stay alive and happy in your body than someone else’s cells (what are other people’s cells doing in your body anyway!?). A lot of important work is being done right now to find where these adult stem cells live and to figure out what makes them so good at continuously helping our body stay healthy.</p>
<p>The other type of stem cells are called Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS Cells). Induced means that scientists worked to make it happen. Pluripotent means that it can transform into any cell type. iPS Cells start as normal cells from your body. Scientists incorporate things called transcription factors that change the DNA of the cell and turn it into a stem cell. The body cell gets re-wired by these transcription factors and gains the power to transform into any cell type. These transcription factors are still being studied and we are still learning exactly how they affect the cell. Scientists have already successfully turned skin and bone cells into iPS Cells! Once a body cell becomes an iPS cell it can divide and can turn into a specific cell type that can complete a specific job depending on what environment it is put into. iPS cells are also cool because they can divide almost forever!</p>
<p>Adult stem cells and iPS cells are both extremely interesting types of stem cells! Adult stem cells can turn into a lot of cell types but not all of them. They are located in specific places and sometimes can be hard to find. Adult stem cells can divide many times but not as many times as iPS cells. iPS cells can keep dividing in perfect conditions almost forever. iPS cells can theoretically be taken from any body cell so they are super plentiful! iPS cells can also turn into any type of cell so they are more versatile than adult stem cells. Both iPS cells and adult stem cells are really great because they can be used in patient specific therapies!</p>
